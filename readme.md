Idea: create a tool to parse test-cases (as check-lists) from mind maps (because my project managers always use them)

Run:
```bash
go run main.go
```

ToDo:
[] modify writing to have more possibilities (writing function, interface, struct)
[] find out how to identify a user, get a bearer token
[] made an API from what I have 
[] research google sheets API
[] add writing to google sheet

Note: gofmt is really handy to keep code beautiful
