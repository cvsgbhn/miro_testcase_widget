Idea: create a tool to parse test-cases (as check-lists) from mind maps (because my project managers always use them)

Run:
```bash
go run main.go
```

ToDo:
- [X] parse multiple schemas on one board 
- [ ] work on envs
- [ ] modify writing to have more possibilities (writing function, interface, struct)
- [ ] find out how to identify a user, get a bearer token
- [ ] add writing to google sheet
- [ ] add writing to testrail
